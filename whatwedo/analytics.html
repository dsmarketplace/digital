             <p>
                 Data is an essential component of any successful marketing strategy. Detailed data insights inform better decisions and provide quantifiable feedback on the returns gained from each investment made.
             </p>

             <p>
                 Standard website and app analytics installations are useful for seeing top level data on traffic patterns, sources and behaviours, but often contain little in the way of specific goal tracking and ecommerce information,
                 and can include unwanted referrals and incorrect traffic that dilute the value of the data therein.
             </p>

             <p>
                 With this in mind, Impression provides tailored consultancy around Analytics account configurations,
                 as well as associated services, technology upgrades to Google Tag Manager or building custom dashboards in Google Analytics,
                 Data Studio or reporting platform of your choosing.

             <p>
                 Any marketer investing in digital knows the level of data we can now access via online channels is granular,
                 extensive and, potentially, incredibly useful.
             </p>

             <p>
                 As we strive toward more integrated strategies and omni-channel approaches, the necessity for accurate tracking and data analytics increases.
                 That’s why more and more businesses are investing in advanced analytics solutions,
                 with Google Data Studio providing the platform for data use.
             </p>

             <p>
                 We’re proud to have worked with global brands right through to local businesses to help them make more of their data using Data Studio,
                 oftentimes integrating multiple data providers to give clearer pictures of the data,
                 which can easily be segmented for different stakeholders to view as they require too.

             <p>
                 Any marketer who champions an omni-channel strategy will know how challenging it can be to report on that strategy.
             </p>

             <p>
                 Inconsistencies between the way different platforms report can be difficult to manage,
                 especially when it comes to goal tracking and ecommerce.
             </p>

             <p>
                 Google Data Layer provides a solution to these challenges by enabling you to pass information between your website and tag providers like Google Tag Manager,
                 Facebook, Twitter and Bing in a more consistent manner.
             </p>

             <p>
                 Use of Data Layer also facilitates management of such tags with minimal reliance on development
                 teams and therefore empowers marketers to be more agile in their use of data.

               At its most basic level, Google Tag Manager empowers marketers to access new data and make changes to their data management with minimal reliance on development teams. This in itself leads to more agile
