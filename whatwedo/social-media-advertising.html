            <h3 >Social Media Advertising</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Lead people with what they want,
                    where they want and when they want through social media advertising efforts.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                With the majority of social media channels continually improving and new ones emerging by the day,
                social ad spend -especially video, and particularly, mobile - has gone supersonic.
            </p>

            <p>
                Social media platforms are where people hang out and spend ever more time - and it's where brands need to be.
                But here's the catch. Social media is an individual's space, that you're not necessarily invited to.
                So you've got to figure out which space you'd like to be part of and how to put yourself there.
            </p>

            <p>
                Get Paid Social right and the rewards are exceptional.
                Get it wrong and it can bite you on the backside,
                and then some. With Paid Social, striking the right balance is absolutely key.
            </p>
            <p>Our approach to Social Media Advertising is simple but incredibly effective.</p>
            <p>
                We believe that our formula, applied to the right business, has the potential to yield insane results
            </p>
            <p>
                We have been running successful
                advertising campaigns on Facebook, Instagram,
                and LinkedIn since 2018.
